# Vue/Tailwind Skills Assessment

Welcome to Logix Software! This exercise is designed to evaluate your experience with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript by developing a product list feature. You will be replicating a component based on a Figma design and populating it using an API call. This project utilizes Nuxt.js, and you can find its documentation [here](https://nuxt.com/).

## Objective

Your task is to develop a single, reusable Vue component that displays a list of products. This component should be styled with Tailwind CSS to match the provided design and ensure responsiveness across different devices. Additionally, you will utilize JavaScript for handling data fetching and other dynamic aspects of the application.

## Design

You can find the design specifications on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/pQ1ORfW4l0cUgHCoex0HU6/eCommerce-Website-%7C-Web-Page-Design-%7C-UI-KIT-%7C-Interior-Landing-Page-(Community)?type=design&node-id=117-394&mode=design&t=hKcZMxD53M2Eb3Cv-4).

## Requirements

- Clone the repository and create a branch named after yourself, for example, "John".
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
- Develop the component, passing the correct props and using Tailwind CSS for styling.(The component should be responsive and display correctly on all device sizes.)
- Fetch the product data from the following endpoint: [API Endpoint](https://dummyjson.com/products).
- Render a list of 8 products based on the data retrieved from the API.(If the API does not provide all the data elements shown in the design, hardcode the missing details to match the design.)
- Ensure that your code is clean, modular, and well-commented.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, please:
1. Ensure your code is pushed to your branch.
2. Create a pull request against the `main` branch for review.
3. Include a brief summary of your implementation and any special instructions needed for testing your component in the pull request description.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to the design specifications.
- Code quality and best practices.
- Proper use of Vue, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
- Responsiveness and usability of the final product.

Thank you for participating in this skills assessment. We look forward to reviewing your submission!
